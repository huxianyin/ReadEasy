Introducing human physiology into a computational cognitive architecture is important. On
the one hand, it provide more realistic models of human to cover the physiological aspect. On
the other hand, with modern sensing technologies, physiological signals can be measured in
real-time and makes it possible to build cognitive models that are synchronized with a specific
person at a specific time. These dynamic cognitive models can be used in many practical ap-
plications concerning human well-being such as fatigue monitoring. However, computational
cognitive architectures with a physiology module stays at a theoretical level. In this study,
we proposed a diagram on how to build dynamic cognitive models synchronized with specific
individuals. A cognitive model conducting N-back task based on the ACT-R cognitive architec-
ture was designed, with its cognitive behavior moderated by bored induced fatigue. Empirical
data of our previous work collected in a well-controlled laboratory experiment verified that
several cognitive parameters of ACT-R can be estimated from multiple physiological features
including heart rate, respiration and pupil diameter using.
